[00:13.25] White knuckles
[00:17.14] And sweaty palms from hangin' on too tight
[00:21.51] Clenched shut jaw
[00:25.75] I've got another headache again tonight
[00:30.30] Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
[00:32.28] And they burn from all the tears
[00:34.56] I've been cryin', I've been cryin'
[00:36.58] I've been dying over you
[00:38.74] Tie a knot in the rope
[00:40.88] Tryin' to hold, tryin' to hold
[00:42.92] But there's nothing to grasp
[00:45.05] So I let go
[00:47.16] I think I finally had enough
[00:49.21] I think I maybe think too much
[00:51.35] I think this might be it for us
[00:53.25] Blow me one last kiss
[00:55.53] You think I'm just too serious
[00:57.58] I think you're full of shit
[00:59.64] My head is spinning, so
[01:01.59] Blow me one last kiss
[01:03.72] Just when it can't get worse
[01:06.04] I've had a shit day
[01:08.28] You've had a shit day
[01:10.25] We've had a shit day
[01:12.44] I think that life's too short for this
[01:14.53] Want back my ignorance and bliss
[01:16.59] I think I've had enough of this
[01:18.46] Blow me one last kiss
[01:28.96] 
[01:24.95] I won't miss
[01:28.77] All of the fighting
[01:30.82] That we always did
[01:33.11] Take it in
[01:36.91] I mean what I say when I say "there is nothing left"
[01:41.74] No more sick
[01:42.86] Whiskey dick
[01:43.92] No more battles from me
[01:45.92] You'll be calling a trick
[01:48.03] 'Cause you no longer sleep
[01:50.31] I'll dress nice, I'll look good
[01:52.37] I'll go dancing alone
[01:54.42] I will laugh, I'll get drunk
[01:56.53] I'll take somebody home
[01:58.73] I think I've finally had enough
[02:00.88] I think I maybe think too much
[02:02.95] I think this might be it for us
[02:04.79] Blow me one last kiss
[02:07.14] You think I'm just too serious
[02:09.29] I think you're full of shit
[02:11.27] My head is spinning, so
[02:13.18] Blow me one last kiss
[02:15.29] Just when it can't get worse
[02:17.60] I've had a shit day
[02:19.63] You've had a shit day
[02:21.77] We've had a shit day
[02:23.97] I think that life's too short for this
[02:26.06] Want back my ignorance and bliss
[02:28.11] I think I've had enough of this
[02:29.94] Blow me one last kiss
[02:32.32] La la la ra ra ra
[02:38.38] Blow me one last kiss
[02:40.51] La la la ra ra ra
[02:46.95] Blow me one last kiss
[02:49.28] I will do what I please
[02:51.23] Anything that I want
[02:53.49] I will breathe, I will breathe
[02:55.45] I won't worry at all
[02:57.66] You will pay for your sins
[02:59.61] You'll be sorry, my dear
[03:01.88] All the lies, all the why's
[03:04.07] Will all be crystal clear
[03:06.19] I think I've finally had enough
[03:08.21] I think I maybe think too much
[03:10.30] I think this might be it for us
[03:12.12] Blow me one last kiss
[03:14.49] You think I'm just too serious
[03:16.66] I think you're full of shit
[03:18.62] My head is spinning, so
[03:20.53] Blow me one last kiss
[03:22.75] Just when it can't get worse
[03:25.00] I've had a shit day
[03:27.21] You've had a shit day
[03:29.24] We've had a shit day
[03:31.30] I think that life's too short for this
[03:33.44] Want back my ignorance and bliss
[03:35.62] I think I've had enough of this
[03:37.37] Blow me one last kiss
[03:39.61] La la la ra ra ra ra
[03:45.73] Blow me one last kiss
[03:48.12] La la la ra ra ra ra
[03:54.23] Blow me one last kiss
[03:56.41] Just when it can't get worse
[03:58.84] I've had a shit day
[04:00.98] You've had a shit day
[04:02.90] We've had a shit day
[04:05.08] I think that life's too short for this
[04:07.08] Want back my ignorance and bliss
[04:09.15] I think I've had enough of this
[04:11.04] Blow me one last kiss
